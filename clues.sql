--               Our playdate of late has been unusually fun –
--               As an agent, I'll say, you've been a joy to outrun.
--               And while the food here is great, and the people – so nice!
--               I need a little more sunshine with my slice of life.
--               So I'm off to add one to the population I find
--               In a city of ninety-one thousand and now, eighty five.
